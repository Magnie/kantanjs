= KantanJS

Because my beginning programming class is a tad too easy, I decided to make
KantanJS (簡単). It is a personal project to get familiar with the idea of
developing frameworks. It is designed to be a framework for doing basic DO
manipulation with the HTML code itself. Similar to AngularJS or VueJS
Though it is not designed to compete with either in any way, shape, or form.

This is also *not* designed for older browsers that don't support the various
newer features of JavaScript (eg. ES6).

Goals:
* k-show for showing/hiding elements (complete)
* k-click for simple DOM interaction (complete)
* k-for to simplify looping over an array and creating relevant elements (complete)
* k-text insert text via variable
* Custom components for content used across pages
* Recursive parsing for k-for elements?

In order to provide a more modern feel and use modern components, I am using
flex box as a way to layout the page. I also modified the default button
styling to look a little cleaner and minimalistic.
