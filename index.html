                        I know this is a cop out on writing my own poem, but I really like this "poem" because it is has been very influential in my personal study of programming. I find that every time I read it, I realize there is something I need to improve on in my programming allowing me to continually improve.

                        I used to do ballroom in elementary and high school. I was on the Lehi Ballroom Dance team and was the Varsity Captain my second year. We earned 1st place in our latin dance.

                        I've been programming since I was 11. In high school I attempted to build an MMORPG. While I wasn't able to build out the full game, I was able to design a scalable server that would separate all the areas you could be in into different zones hosted on different (or the same) physical machine where you could seemlessly transfer to different zones/servers. Turned out to be a similar idea to the way Kubernetes works.

                        During high school I watched a lot of anime and after I graduated I started learning it together with a friend. Then we discovered that a Church member of our's was Japanese, so we asked her to teach us Japanese. After learning for about a year by visiting with her once a week or so I went to Japan as a volunteer for 2 years. Now I speak almost daily with my friend who is about to graduate in Japanese from BYU.
